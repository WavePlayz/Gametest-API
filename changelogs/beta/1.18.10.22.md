1.18.10.22 changes:

Added new entity query capabilities in the form of new methods on Dimension and World.

### World object
- Replaced function getPlayers : Player[] with function getPlayers(options: EntityQueryOptions = undefined) : EntityIterator- Returns an iterator to a collection containing all players in the dimension. Optionally, options can be used to filter the result
Added optional argument to events.addEffect. This argument will limit the callback to only fire for specific entities (see EntityEventOptions)

### Dimension object
- Added function getPlayers(options: EntityQueryOptions = undefined) : EntityIterator- Returns an iterator to a collection containing all players. Optionally, options can be used to filter the result
- Added function getEntities(options: EntityQueryOptions = undefined) : EntityIterator- Returns an iterator to a collection containing all entities in the dimension. Optionally, options can be used to filter the result

### EntityQueryOptions
- Added class EntityQueryOptions- Provides additional filtering options when calling getEntities and getPlayers

### EntityQueryScoreOptions
- Added class EntityQueryScoreOptions- Used with EntityQueryOptions to provide scoreboard filtering

### EntityEventOptions
- Used to filter events that fire on entities to restrict the callback to only certain ones.
- Property entity: Entity[] - If specified, will restrict to just this entity
- Property entityTypes: string[] - If specified, will restrict to entities with the specified type (e.g., minecraft:creeper)
