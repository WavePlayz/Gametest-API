## GameTest Framework
There are some important breaking changes in APIs creators should be aware of:

- Renamed mojang-minecraft:Worldobject to mojang-minecraft:world (World still exists but is the type instead of the instance of the world)
In practice, this means “World.getDimension” code should now read “world.getDimension”
- Removed mojang-minecraft:Commands- Instead, we are adding runCommand methods on dimension, entity, and player
In practice, this means that “Commands.run(“say Hello World”, dimension)” should now read “dimension.runCommand(“say Hello World”)”

### Many exciting new API adds, as well:

- mojang-minecraft:ItemStack
  -  Item use events:
    - Added event World.event.beforeItemUse - Fires before an item is used. Can be cancelled
